# Backend Assessment

Build and deploy a very simple API that does the following

1.  Calculate and return the age of a person, given their date of birth (dob) as query parameters to `GET /howold`
2.  Limit calls to `GET /howold` and prevent excessive usage from potentially ill-configured or malicious integrators. Only allow a maximum of 3 calls per second for each API client/caller
